    Carroll, and Madison have lost over 30% of enrollment
7.  **Jefferson Parish: suburban stability** - Louisiana’s
    second-largest maintains steady enrollment
8.  **English learners on the rise** - EL students have grown from 3% to
    over 5% of enrollment
9.  **Economic disadvantage concentrated in the Delta** - Delta parishes

## Installation

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("almartin82/laschooldata")
```

## Quick Start

### R

``` r
library(laschooldata)
library(dplyr)

# Fetch one year
enr_2025 <- fetch_enr(2025)

# Fetch recent years
enr_recent <- fetch_enr_multi(2020:2025)

# State totals
enr_2025 %>%
  filter(is_state, subgroup == "total_enrollment", grade_level == "TOTAL")

# Parish (district) breakdown
enr_2025 %>%
  filter(is_district, subgroup == "total_enrollment", grade_level == "TOTAL") %>%
  arrange(desc(n_students))

# Demographics statewide
enr_2025 %>%
  filter(is_state, grade_level == "TOTAL",
         subgroup %in% c("white", "black", "hispanic", "asian")) %>%
  select(subgroup, n_students, pct)
```

### Python

``` python
import pylaschooldata as la

# Fetch 2025 data (2024-25 school year)
enr = la.fetch_enr(2025)

# Statewide total
total = enr[(enr['is_state']) & (enr['grade_level'] == 'TOTAL') &
            (enr['subgroup'] == 'total_enrollment')]['n_students'].sum()
print(f"{total:,} students")
#> ~680,000 students

# Get multiple years
enr_multi = la.fetch_enr_multi([2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025])

# Check available years
years = la.get_available_years()
print(f"Data available: {years['min_year']}-{years['max_year']}")
#> Data available: 2007-2025
```
